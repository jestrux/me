    A frontend developer from Tanzania East Africa.

<p class="mt-4">
    I have 8 years of experience building on the web and have done most web development projects; from simple one-page websites, animation-driven landing pages, large information-heavy multipage corporate websites, highly interactive single-page apps that consume an API, desktop apps with electron. I’ve also built Chrome extensions and plugins for both Adobe Xd and Adobe Express.

    <p class="mt-2 text-lg/loose">
        I’ve worked with most frontend libraries and frameworks from modern ones like <strong>React</strong>, Vue, AlpineJS, and Svelte to older ones like <strong>JQuery</strong>, AngularJS, and Polymer. I’m very proficient with CSS both custom-written and using <strong>TailwindCSS</strong> which is my current preferred styling choice.
