            While I'm mostly a front-end person, I do my fair share of back-end development work(mostly building CMSes) with Laravel and occasionally NodeJS. This also means that I work really well with backend developers because Iâ€™m familiar with how they work.

            Here's a headless CMS / API generation library I made for Laravel to streamline repetitive parts of creating CMS.
